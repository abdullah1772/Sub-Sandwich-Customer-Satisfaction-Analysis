Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Subway Customer Satisfaction Analysis" project. As a data enthusiast, I embarked on this fascinating journey to explore customer satisfaction across various sub sandwich chain restaurants in the USA, with a special focus on Subway.

# Project Overview

Project Name: Subway Customer Satisfaction Analysis

Objective: The main goal of this project is to identify key drivers that can potentially boost customer satisfaction and sales for Subway. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset encompassing various American sub sandwich chains, I aimed to uncover insights specifically beneficial for Subway.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a rich compilation of customer satisfaction metrics from various USA-based sub sandwich chain restaurants. It includes a variety of key drivers for every restaurant, providing a holistic view of what influences customer satisfaction in this sector.

# Analysis Approach

In my analysis, I employed a range of data analytics techniques to dissect and understand the dataset thoroughly. The key steps in my approach included:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring the data is accurate and formatted correctly for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights and identifying trends and patterns within the dataset.

Key Driver Analysis: Pinpointing the factors that most significantly impact customer satisfaction.

# Leveraging XGBoost

A significant part of my analysis involved using XGBoost, an efficient and powerful machine learning technique. By applying XGBoost, I was able to:

Identify the most influential factors impacting customer satisfaction.

Predict areas where Subway can improve to enhance customer experiences and boost sales.

# Findings and Recommendations

Through my analysis, I uncovered several key drivers that Subway can adopt to elevate customer satisfaction levels. These findings are detailed in the notebook and accompanied by data-driven recommendations tailored for Subway.
